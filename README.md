# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
#### Airline-Customer-Model — Machine Learning Project on: Scikit-learn / Pandas / Matplotlib / Seaborn

Machine learning project focused on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction. The model explores factors influencing satisfaction levels using Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The results will help identify key areas for improvement and predict satisfaction based on variables such as gender, age, and class of service. The project aims to enhance overall passenger experience.

#### Stack:
